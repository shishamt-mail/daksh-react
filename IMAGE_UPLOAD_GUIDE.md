## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Image URL doesn't work in admin panel
**Solution:** Make sure you're using the **direct link** (ends with .jpg, .png, etc.), not a page link

### Issue: Image appears broken
**Solution:**
- Check if the URL is correct and complete
- Verify the image hosting service didn't delete it
- Try uploading to a different service

### Issue: Image loads slowly
**Solution:**
- Reduce file size before uploading
- Compress images using https://tinypng.com/
- Choose a better hosting service

### Issue: Image gets deleted after a while
**Solution:**
- Create an account on the hosting service (prevents auto-deletion)
- Use reliable services like Cloudinary or ImgBB
- Keep backup copies of your images

## Example URLs

Here's what a proper image URL looks like:

### Good URLs (Direct Links):
```
https://i.ibb.co/xYzAbcd/brand-logo.png
https://res.cloudinary.com/myaccount/image/upload/v1234567890/logo.jpg
https://i.imgur.com/AbCd123.jpg
```

### Bad URLs (These won't work):
```
https://imgbb.com/album/xyz (album page, not direct link)
https://cloudinary.com/console (dashboard link)
C:\Users\Desktop\image.jpg (local file path)
```

## Bulk Upload Workflow

If you have many products to add:

1. **Prepare all images first:**
   - Resize and optimize all images
   - Name them systematically (product1-img1.jpg, product1-img2.jpg, etc.)

2. **Upload in batches:**
   - Upload 10-20 images at once to your hosting service
   - Keep a spreadsheet with product names and their image URLs

3. **Add to admin panel:**
   - Use the spreadsheet to quickly copy-paste URLs
   - Much faster than uploading one at a time

## Mobile Upload (Using Phone)

1. Take product photos with your phone
2. Open browser and go to https://imgbb.com/
3. Select "Upload from device"
4. Choose your photos
5. Copy the direct link
6. Open admin panel and paste the URL

## Recommended Workflow for New Users

**First Time Setup:**
1. Create a Cloudinary free account (future-proof)
2. Upload all your existing images there
3. Organize images in folders (logos, banners, products)

**For Each New Item:**
1. Prepare the image (resize, optimize)
2. Upload to Cloudinary
3. Copy the secure URL
4. Paste in admin panel
5. Save

## Alternative: Using Your Own Website

If you have web hosting or want to use your own domain:

1. Upload images to your website's server
2. Use your domain URLs: `https://yourdomain.com/images/logo.png`
3. Make sure the images folder is publicly accessible
4. This gives you complete control

## Need Help?
