# Check Your Error - Quick Guide

## What to Do Right Now

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
1. Press **F12** (or right-click anywhere → Inspect)
2. Click the **Console** tab
3. Try adding a brand again
4. Look for the error message in red

### Step 2: What Does the Error Say?

#### If you see: "Failed to fetch" or "NetworkError"
**Problem:** Backend not connected

**Fix:**
```bash
# In backend terminal, restart:
cd backend
python app.py
```

Make sure you see: `Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000`

---

#### If you see: "401 Unauthorized"
**Problem:** Login expired

**Fix:**
1. Logout from admin panel
2. Login again
3. Try adding brand again

---

#### If you see: "500 Internal Server Error"
**Problem:** Backend error

**Fix:**
1. Look at your **backend terminal** (where you ran `python app.py`)
2. You'll see a detailed error message there
3. It will tell you exactly what's wrong

**Most common backend errors:**

```
KeyError: 'name'
```
→ Missing required field. Fill all fields in the form.

```
pymongo.errors...
```
→ MongoDB connection issue. Check internet connection.

#### If you see: "Response not ok: 400"
**Problem:** Invalid data sent

**Fix:**
Check these fields:
- Logo URL must be a valid URL
- Banner URL must be a valid URL
- Display Order must be a number
- All required fields filled

---

### Step 3: Quick Checks

✅ **Backend running?**
- Look at backend terminal
- Should say: "Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000"

✅ **Logged in?**
- Can you see the Dashboard?
- Does it show statistics?

✅ **Form filled correctly?**
- Brand Name: Not empty
- Logo URL: Starts with http:// or https://
- Banner URL: Starts with http:// or https://
- Description: Not empty
- Display Order: A number (1, 2, 3, etc.)

✅ **Image URLs are direct links?**
Test by opening URL in new tab - you should see ONLY the image, not a webpage.

---

## Try This Quick Test

### Test the Backend Manually

1. **Open new browser tab**
2. **Go to:** http://localhost:5000/api/health
3. **You should see:**
   ```json
   {
     "status": "healthy",
     "database": "connected"
   }
   ```

**If you see this** → Backend is working fine
**If you see error** → Backend has a problem

## Debug Mode - See Everything

I've updated the code to show detailed errors. Now:

- **Browser console** will show the exact error
- **Backend terminal** will show what data it received
- Error messages are more specific

When you try to add a brand now, watch BOTH:
1. Browser console (F12 → Console)
2. Backend terminal

One of them will tell you exactly what's wrong!

## Still Stuck?

Take screenshots of:
1. The error in browser console (F12)
2. The backend terminal output
3. The form you're filling

And I can tell you exactly what's wrong!
